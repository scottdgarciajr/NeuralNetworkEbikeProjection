This project includes a neural network that I wrote for the Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge in 2023 and an ARIMA model I wrote code for in MATLAB. The purpose of the neural is to take in data on e-bike sales, train a neural network on it, and then use the weights that the neural network assigns to each input in order to quantify the impact that different factors may have on e-bike sales. The purpose of the ARIMA model was to predict future e-bike sales.
