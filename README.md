# NeuralNetworkEbikeProjection
This is a neural network that I wrote for the Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge in 2023.  The purpose of this code is to take in statistics about ebike sales and other factors that could change it. The point of the neural network is to find the weights for each factor, and thus find how much each factor impacts the ebike sales
